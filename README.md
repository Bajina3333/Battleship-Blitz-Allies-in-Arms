Game Introduction:
In this game, you will first choose a player character (from three options). Each player character will be randomly paired with a partner (also from three options). Different types of partners provide various benefits to the player, such as increased speed or enhanced attack abilities. The partner will follow the player and shoot automatically.

You can control the character's movement using the arrow keys, and switch to the English input method to press the space bar to shoot bullets. If you get hit by bullets fired by enemies, you will lose health; if you collide directly with enemies, you will lose even more health.

The game has three difficulty levels and a final boss stage, each difficulty level consisting of three waves. At the end of each wave, based on the proportion of enemies you shoot down to the total number of enemies that appeared in that wave, you will be rated 1 to 3 stars, and rewarded with a different amount of gold accordingly.

Whenever the difficulty level changes, the system will randomly give the player an item that helps in the next stage of the game (such as increased attack power, speed, or health).

At the end of each wave, the player has a 1/3 chance to trigger a "Community Chest and Chance" event. These events include nine different good and bad situations, such as winning a prize, falling into a black hole gravity field which slows down the player, losing all gold, or gaining additional benefits from the partner. These events will significantly impact the subsequent gameplay.

遊戲說明：
在這款遊戲中，你將首先選擇一位玩家角色（從三個選項中選擇一個）。每位玩家角色會隨機搭配一位夥伴（同樣從三個選項中選擇），不同類型的夥伴將為玩家提供不同的增益效果，如提高速度、增強攻擊能力等。夥伴會跟隨玩家移動並自動射擊。

玩家可以通過上下左右鍵來控制角色移動，切換至英文輸入法後按下空格鍵發射子彈。如果碰到敵人射出的子彈，將扣減生命值；若直接碰到敵人本身，將扣減更多的生命值。

遊戲設有三個難度和最終BOSS關卡，每個難度下又分為三個波次。每波結束時，根據玩家射下的敵人數量占該波次敵人總數的比例，評定1至3星，並根據星等獲得不同數量的金幣獎勵。

每當難度切換時，系統將隨機給予玩家一個有助於接下來遊戲進行的道具（如增加攻擊能力、提升速度或增加生命值）。

在每波遊戲結束後，玩家有1/3的機率觸發“機會與命運”事件。這些事件包括九種不同的好壞情況，如中獎、掉入黑洞引力場導致速度減慢、損失所有金幣、或因為夥伴獲得額外的增益效果，這些事件將對接下來的遊戲進行產生顯著影響。
